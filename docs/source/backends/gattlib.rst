Backend: :mod:`gattlib`
=======================

PyMetaWear can use ``gattlib`` as BLE communication backend. It is installed
as a subpackage to `pybluez <https://github.com/karulis/pybluez>`_, a
requirement to make documentation buildable on Travis CI.

Code for ``gattlib`` can be found on
`Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/OscarAcena/pygattlib>`_.
